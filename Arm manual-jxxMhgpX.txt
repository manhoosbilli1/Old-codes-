Base:
	going left command  = 0
	going right command = 180 
	stop command        = 90

pivot:
	MAX value = 180      ( travels from right to left making 180 degree)
	min Value = 10       ( keep this 10 degree to keep this from hitting the plastic
	picking Value = 
	default value = 100  (value set when doing the default function) 


upperPivot: 

	default value = 40
	picking up = 140
	max value = 180    (will rotate completely! advised not to enter this value)
	minValue  = 0

ClawRotator:
	
	bring to horizontal = 90
	bring to vertical = 180

claw: 
	Close claw = 30
	Open  claw = 90 


NOTE: You can achieve high speed function by replacing the forloop in "moveTo" functions simply with myservo.write(value)


NOTE: ONLY call CALL THE ARMFUNCTION WHEN THE ARDUINO IS NOT DOING ANYTHING ELSE. OTHERWISE IT MIGHT RESULT IN TIMING ISSU
It is advised to stop the motor before carrying out the arm function
